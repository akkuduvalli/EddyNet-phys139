# EddyNet-phys139
Originally developed by R. Lguensat et al. in the paper “EddyNet: A Deep Neural Network for Pixel-Wise Classification of Oceanic Eddies”
Eddynet is a CNN that seeks to classify ocean-mesoscale eddies from Sea Surface Height (SSH) altimetry data from AVISO+
Eddynet classifies the following features: cyclonic eddies, anticyclonic eddies, and non-eddies
